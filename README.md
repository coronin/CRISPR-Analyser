#CRISPR Analyser

##Summary
This module is a collection of C++ scripts that has the primary function of finding off targets for a CRISPR site as quick as possible, for any species. This is achieved by: 

1. Creating an index of every CRISPR site within the target genome 
2. Loading that index into memory (requires 2.4GB~ memory for Human)
3. Brute force checking the specified site against every possible CRISPR site  

For memory efficiency the index only contains a unique id and sequence, so is only really useful if you create a database to run along side the analyser. You can see ours here:

http://www.sanger.ac.uk/htgt/wge/

The code for the website is on github:

https://github.com/htgt/WGE

##Speed
The initial load time of the index will depend entirely on the speed of the disk you store it on. An index will be 2-3gb which is _all_ loaded into memory; for us this usually takes about 5 seconds per index. This is quite high if you are searching for a single CRISPR at a time, so generally I recommend using the server so you only have to load the index once.

Once the application has loaded all the CRISPRs into memory it usually takes 2-4 seconds to find all off targets with up to 4 mismatches for a gRNA. The program can be easily modified to check for more than 4 mismatches, but it was not feasible for us to store off targets with any more than 4 mismatches in our database.

##Database
You will want to create a postgres database to store the actual CRISPR data, here is our CRISPR table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE crisprs (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    chr_name text NOT NULL,
    chr_start integer NOT NULL,
    seq text NOT NULL,
    pam_right boolean NOT NULL,
    species_id integer NOT NULL,
    off_target_ids integer[],
    off_target_summary text,
);
```

To have multiple species you should leave this is a parent table with no rows, and make a child table for each species, e.g.:

```sql
CREATE TABLE crisprs_human (
    CHECK ((species_id = 1))
)
INHERITS (crisprs);
```

You will also want some indexes/constraints:

```sql
ALTER TABLE ONLY crisprs_mouse ADD CONSTRAINT crisprs_mouse_unique_loci UNIQUE (chr_start, chr_name, pam_right);
CREATE INDEX idx_crisprs_mouse_loci ON crisprs_mouse USING btree (chr_name, chr_start);
```

If you are using inheritance each timeyou add a new species crispr table you need to add a primary key:
```sql
alter table crisprs_dog add constraint crisprs_dog_pkey primary key (id);
```

Or finding a CRISPR by ID will run incredibly slowly.

You can see how to populate this table in the next section

##Build
The actual build step is very simple, and simply requires running make:

```
git clone https://github.com/htgt/CRISPR-Analyser.git
cd CRISPR-Analyser
make
```

But before the program can be used you must create an index:

###Find all CRISPRs within the genome
Unfortunately this is the hardest part at the moment because I haven't had time to re-write my original script I generated from eons ago. When I get time this script will be added as a command inside crispr_analyser

This step produces a .csv of all CRISPRs in a given genome, which can be run directly into a psql copy statement to quickly add rows to a table.

For now you will have to get this script

[https://github.com/htgt/Crisprs/blob/alex/cpp/get_all_crisprs.cpp](https://github.com/htgt/Crisprs/blob/alex/cpp/get_all_crisprs.cpp)

Compile it with:

```
g++ -std=c++0x -O3 -W -Wall -o get_all_crisprs get_all_crisprs.cpp
```

Then run:

```
get_all_crisprs <species_id> /location/of/genome.fa > /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/human_crisprs_fixed.csv
```

where species_id is whatever you have assigned in your database. It should probably be 1.

You can then load this into your database in psql:

```
\copy crisprs_human(chr_name, chr_start, seq, pam_right, species_id) from '/lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/human_crisprs_fixed.csv' with delimiter ',';
```

and now you can create an index.

###Create index
Once you have generated the csv file(s) above you can give them to the crispr_analyser index command with the -i flag:

```
./bin/crispr_analyser index -i /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/GRCh37.tsv -o /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/crisprs_human.bin -s Human -a GRCh37 -e 1
```

*Note*: the -i flag can be set multiple times to read from many input files 

The other options:

<pre>
 -i    The input files
 -o    The file to output the binary index to
 -s    The species name 
 -e    The species ID in your database
 -a    The assembly
</pre>

You can now skip to the usage section unless you want to use more than 1 species

#####Indexing a second species
If you are storing the CRISPRs in a database, all CRISPRs must have a unique ID so to add a second species you must add one more flag:

<pre>
 -f    The offset that your database IDs begin with
</pre>

For example, to add the second species you should start the CRISPR ids in your database at 300,000,001 and set -f to 300,000,000:

```
./bin/crispr_analyser index -i /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/mouse_first_10_fixed.tsv -i /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/mouse_after_10_fixed.tsv -o /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/GRCm38_index.bin -s Mouse -a GRCm38 -e 2 -f 300000000
```

Meaning 300,000,000 should be subtracted from whatever ID is given to get a species localised ID, as 300,000,001 here corresponds to Mouse CRISPR 1

##Usage

###Retrieve an ID given a gRNA
You can find all possible ids for a given gRNA with the search command:

```
./bin/crispr_analyser search -i /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/crispr_indexes/GRCh37_index.bin -s GTGTCAGTGAAACTTACTCT
```

Which outputs:
<pre>
Loaded 298539596 sequences
Loading took 2.230000 seconds
Found 1 exact matches
Scanning took 0.840000 seconds
Found the following matches:
	245377736
</pre>

###Find off targets
Finding off targets requires IDs rather than sequence:

```
./bin/crispr_analyser search -i /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/crispr_indexes/GRCh37_index.bin 245377736 345345636 245373336 
```

With as many ids as necessary separated by a space.

A range mode is also supported:
```
./bin/crispr_analyser align -s 245377736 -n 1000
```

This will output off target data for ids 245377736-245377836

The off target data looks like this:
<pre>
245377736	1	{2500136,2872353,6251446,...,290706188,293805107,294577530}	{0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 9, 4: 126}
</pre>

Which is TSV data with 4 columns:

1. CRISPR ID
2. Species ID
3. Postgres array of CRISPR IDs
4. YAML off target summary data string

With the intention being that the output fields are dumped straight into your database

##Server Usage
The server supports returns JSON or JSONP if a callback is given. 

The server has two modes of operation:

1. Finding off targets given an id (or ids)
2. Retrieving an id given a single 20bp gRNA sequence

###Start the server
The server currently only supports human and mouse genomes which are added with the -l and -m flags respectively:

```
./bin/ots_server -l /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/crispr_indexes/GRCh37_index.bin -m /lustre/scratch109/sanger/ah19/crispr_indexes/GRCm38_index.bin
```

But a new species flag can easily be added. 

The full options:
<pre>
         -t INT     The number of threads the server should use. Default is 5
         -p INT     The port to run the server on
         -l FILE    The file containing the human CRISPR index
         -m FILE    The file containing the mouse CRISPR index
         -s         Load the default mouse/crispr indexes (sanger only)
         -d         Daemon mode
</pre>

If you are at sanger the -s option will load our genome indexes for mouse and human that are world viewable on lustre. 

###Off target searching
To find off targets there are two required parameters:

- ids - this can be a single id, or multiple can be specified in a comma separated string, like "253453634,23645743,473539233"
- species - this is a string with whatever species you have added to the server

You can view the json output by simply visiting the appropriate URL:

[http://localhost:8080/api/off_targets?ids=245377726&species=human](http://localhost:8080/api/off_targets?ids=245377726&species=human)

Or from a javascript console:

```javascript
$.getJSON("http://localhost:8080/api/off_targets?callback=?", {"ids":"245377736", "species": "Human"}, function (data) { console.log(data) });
```

Which will return the following wrapped in a callback:

```JSON
{
    "245377736": {
        "id": 245377736,
        "off_targets": [
            2500136,
            2872353,
            6251446,
            ...
            290706188,
            293805107,
            294577530
        ],
        "off_target_summary": "{0: 1, 1: 0, 2: 0, 3: 9, 4: 126}"
    }
}
```

#####Multiple IDs:
[http://localhost:8080/api/off_targets?ids=245377726,245377730&species=human]([http://localhost:8080/api/off_targets?ids=245377726,245377730&species=human)

###Sequence searching
Sequence searching works in a very similar way:

Viewing the JSON by going straight to the URL:

[http://localhost:8080/api/search?seq=TTAATTGTTTAGCAGTGTCA&species=mouse](http://localhost:8080/api/search?seq=TTAATTGTTTAGCAGTGTCA&species=mouse)

Or from a javascript console:

```javascript
$.getJSON("http://localhost:8080/api/search?callback=?", {"seq":"TTAATTGTTTAGCAGTGTCA", "species":"mouse"}, function (data) { console.log(data) });
```

Which returns:
```JSON
[342905617]
```
